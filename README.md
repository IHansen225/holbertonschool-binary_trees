## Repository: C - Binary trees
### Authors: [@Ihansen225](https://www.github.com/Ihansen225)
Binary trees research and testing exercises.
### Tools used:
- [Vim editor for Linux](https://www.vim.org/)
- [Gcc compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/) (using `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`)

### Learning objectives:
#### General
-   What is a binary tree
-   What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
-   What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
-   What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
-   What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
-   What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
